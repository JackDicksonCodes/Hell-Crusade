# Hell-Crusade
Made by Jack (https://github.com/JackOfDickson) and Matt (https://github.com/Matt-Matthaiou) this is our first unity project which we used to learn unity and C#
This was a great experience we made under a couple of weeks with very little prior knowledge of unity and we hope you enjoy checking it out!

## Playing our game!
When you clone the repository click on the game folder and open either the windows or mac build depending on your operating system

### Controls
The game is a top down shooter so:
W,A,S,D moves your character
Left click shoots the weapon in the direction of your mouse
R to reload the gun
Space to perform a short but quick dash

### Walkthrough
In the first section move the candles into the oddly coloured tiles, this will open the door to the north.
In the second section shoot the moving targets to get a feel how the gun works. When all the targets are destroyed the doors will open.
The third section will be a series of rooms where you need to kill the enemies to proceed. There will be a large door to move onto the final section.
The final section is a boss which has multiple phases and a set of different attacks.
